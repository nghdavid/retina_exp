%% It is adopted from STAR-METHODS of Activity Correlations between Direction-Selective Retinal Ganglion Cells Synergistically Enhance Motion Decoding from Complex Visual Scenes
%{
It used flashes of 500 ms of increased or decreased light level at 40% from mean luminance alternately, interleaved by 1.5 s of mean luminance. 

To assess the degree of ON versus OFF responses, an ON-OFF index was
calculated from the spike countsfonandfoff, measured in a time window of 50
to 550 ms after the onset of the ON- and OFF-flash, respectively, such that
the ．．Flashes ON-OFF Index・・ is (f_on-f_off)/(f_on+f_off)
